          <p>
            I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful
            design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
            creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.

            Currently, I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer specializing in modern web technologies. I contribute to the
            creation and maintenance of scalable applications, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards
            and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.

            In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings â€” from advertising
            agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios. Additionally, I also
            released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners through building a web app with
            modern frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I'm usually reading, exploring new technologies, or working on side projects that push my
            skills forward.
